## Cleanroom Relauncher

**Supports only the major Cleanroom versions via GitHub releases at the moment.**

**Supports client-side relaunching, server-side soon.**

Relaunches a Forge 1.12.2 instance with Cleanroom Loader. Allowing modpack authors to build instances with Cleanroom in mind.

It offers a GUI when on the client, to configure various things before the first relaunch, such as java path and cleanroom versions.

Cleanroom Loader is a new loader developed from the roots of Forge Mod Loader for Minecraft 1.12.2 specifically. It boasts better performance, modern Java support, and offers better experiences for mod developers.
